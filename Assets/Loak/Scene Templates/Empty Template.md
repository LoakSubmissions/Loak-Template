### What can I do with this template?

Anything! We provide this template in case none of our others suit your needs. You can mix and match any of the Lightship or Loak features and tools to your hearts content. You can also use this template if you don't need any of the provided tools, but just want a Lightship scene that's already set up for you. If you need any ideas, check out the [Lightship wesbite](https://lightship.dev/) or [Our Website](https://www.loak.co/) to see what us and other people have made!

### I have questions that aren't answered here.

If you still need help, feel free to reach out to us through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/y8wzR8MKKk). If your problem is with a Lightship feature and not the Loak tools provided in this template, you may get better results by asking in [Lightship's forum](https://community.lightship.dev/) or [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RM6m4nWmYp).
